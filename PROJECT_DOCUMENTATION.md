# EduQuest - Online Learning Platform
## Project Documentation

### 1. Abstract / Executive Summary

The EduQuest is a modern, responsive online learning platform built using React, TypeScript, and Vite. The project focuses on providing a comprehensive educational experience where users can browse courses, view detailed course information, manage their learning dashboard, and access various educational resources effortlessly.

The application leverages React Router for smooth navigation, Context API for efficient state management, and Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components for a clean, responsive UI. It simulates core features of a real-world online learning platform, including user authentication, course browsing, enrollment management, and personalized learning experiences.

### 2. Introduction

#### 2.1 Problem Statement

In today's digital age, online learning has become increasingly popular, but many platforms lack intuitive interfaces, responsive design, and seamless user experiences. Building a smooth, responsive, and interactive online learning platform requires careful planning and efficient frontend development.

This project addresses the problem by creating a React-based online learning frontend where users can browse educational courses, manage their learning progress, view course details, and simulate enrollment processes seamlessly.

### 3. Requirements

#### 3.1 Functional Requirements

- **FR-1**: Users should be able to sign up, log in, and log out seamlessly.
- **FR-2**: Users should be able to browse available courses and view detailed course information.
- **FR-3**: Users should be able to view course categories, instructors, and course ratings.
- **FR-4**: Users should be able to access a personalized dashboard with learning progress.
- **FR-5**: The app should provide a responsive and intuitive interface across all devices.
- **FR-6**: Users should be able to view course details, pricing, and enrollment options.

#### 3.2 User Stories / Use Cases

- As a new user, I want to create an account so that I can access personalized features like course recommendations and learning dashboard.
- As a returning user, I want to log in so that I can manage my learning progress and access enrolled courses.
- As a learner, I want to browse available courses so that I can find relevant educational content.
- As a student, I want to view course details and instructor information so that I can make informed decisions.
- As a user, I want to access a responsive interface so that I can learn on any device.

### 4. System Design & Architecture

#### 4.1 High-Level Architecture

- **Frontend (React + TypeScript + Vite)**: Handles UI, routing, state management, and mock data.
- **Mock Data Source**: Course information, user data, and educational content stored locally.
- **State Management (Context API)**: Manages user authentication, course data, and application state.
- **UI Components (shadcn/ui)**: Reusable, accessible UI components built on Radix UI primitives.

#### 4.2 Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **State Management**: React Context API + React Hooks
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form + Zod validation
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom styling
- **Notifications**: Sonner + React Toastify

#### 4.3 Component Design

| Component | Responsibility |
|-----------|----------------|
| Navigation | Displays app logo, navigation links, user authentication status, and responsive mobile menu |
| HeroBackground | Dynamic hero section with image/video carousel and call-to-action elements |
| CourseCard | Displays course information with pricing, ratings, and enrollment options |
| Index (Home) | Renders hero section, statistics, categories, features, and featured courses |
| Courses | Displays all available courses with filtering and search capabilities |
| CourseDetail | Shows detailed course information, curriculum, and enrollment options |
| Dashboard | User's personalized learning dashboard and progress tracking |
| Login/Signup | Authentication forms for user registration and login |
| About | Information about the platform and its mission |

#### 4.4 Routing

| Path | Page | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `/` | Home | Landing page with hero section and featured content |
| `/courses` | Courses | Browse all available courses |
| `/course/:id` | Course Detail | Detailed view of a specific course |
| `/course/:id/enroll` | Enroll | Course enrollment page |
| `/dashboard` | Dashboard | User's learning dashboard |
| `/about` | About | Platform information and mission |
| `/login` | Login | User authentication |
| `/signup` | Signup | User registration |
| `/demo` | Demo | Platform demonstration |
| `*` | NotFound | 404 error page |

#### 4.5 State Management Strategy

**Context API handles:**
- User authentication state
- Course data and filtering
- Application-wide settings

**Local State (useState):** 
- Form inputs (email, password, search queries)
- UI state (mobile menu, modal states)
- Component-specific data

**Custom Hooks:**
- `useMobile`: Responsive design utilities
- `useToast`: Notification management

### 5. Implementation

#### 5.1 Project Setup

**Tooling:** Vite + TypeScript
**Setup Commands:**
```bash
npm create vite@latest edventure-studio -- --template react-ts
cd edventure-studio
npm install
npm run dev
```

**Directory Structure:**
